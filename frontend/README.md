# Superhero Humility Tracker

This project consists of two parts:

1. **Hono API**: A lightweight API built with the Hono framework that lets users add and fetch superheroes (with name, superpower, and humility score).  
2. **React App**: A simple frontend built with React that interacts with the API to display and add superheroes.

## Project Setup

### React App (Frontend)
- **Location:** `/frontend`
- **Installation & Run:**
  1. Install dependencies:
     ```bash
     bun install
     ```
  2. Start the dev server:
     ```bash
     bun run dev
     ```
- **Usage:** The app fetches superheroes from the API and allows you to add new ones via a form.

## Team Collaboration & Attitude

*Team Player Attitude:*  
I value clear communication and open collaboration. I would work closely with teammates by regularly sharing updates, reviewing each other’s code, and pairing on tasks. For example, if a teammate proposes a new feature or improvement (such as adding authentication or persistent storage), I’d engage in discussion, share my ideas, and work together on a plan to implement the changes.

## If I Had More Time

*Eagerness to Learn:*  
- **Persistent Storage:** Replace the in-memory database with a real database for data persistence.
- **Testing:** Add unit and integration tests for both the API and frontend.
- **Deployment:** Explore deployment options (e.g., serverless platforms) to make the app production-ready.
- **UI/UX Enhancements:** Further polish the React app's user interface and add responsive design improvements.

## Humility and Communication

I believe that continuous learning and honest communication are key to a successful project. All feedback is welcomed, and I’m happy to explain my decisions and listen to suggestions for improvement.
